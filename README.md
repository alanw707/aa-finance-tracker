# aa-finance-tracker App

Hi Welcome to my project! I created this project after Mint shutdown and I just couldn't find an expense tracker application that I liked.

### Features

- Expense Logging
- Banking Integration
- Budgeting Tools
- Investment Tracking
- Financial Planning

# Tech Stack

## Server Side

- [.NET 8.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
- [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) on SQL Server 2022.
- Repository Pattern

### Client Side

- Angular

## Development Plan

- Phase 1

  - Enitiy Frameowork Code First (EF Core) for data persistence.
  - .NET WEB API with basic CRUD
  - Implement Repository Pattern
  - Implement Unit Testing and Code Coverage.

- Phase 2
  - Implement CQRS
  - Implement Client UI
  - Implement Banking Integration with Plaid API and Financial Data Providers API's.
  - Implement Budgeting Tools with Charts and Graphs.
  - Implement Financial Planning with Goal Setting and Budgeting.
  - Implement Security and Authentication.

## Challenges

- EF Core is a new technology for me and it is a bit finicky, it is often difficult when working with it to understand the error messages and find the cause of the error. I am still learning the best practices for using it and I am confident that I will be able to overcome these challenges as I continue to work on the project.

  - CLI tool is not user friendly
  - Updating Database Schemas
  - Working with Forien Keys

- Unit Testing
  - Test driven development
  - Figuring out how to plan and what to implement each test case from Arrange, Act to Assert.
